        <dt>Attack on Titan</dt>
        <dd>
          Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous
          humanoid creatures called Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear
          behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly
          terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of
          hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their
          survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive
          barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan
          encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a
          colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer
          wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating
          abominations. <br />

          Ichigo Kurosaki is an ordinary high schoolerâ€”until his family is
          attacked by a Hollow, a corrupt spirit that seeks to devour human
          souls. It is then that he meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki, who
          gets injured while protecting Ichigo's family from the assailant. To
          save his family, Ichigo accepts Rukia's offer of taking her powers and
          becomes a Soul Reaper as a result.<br />

          A series of eerily similar suicides occupy newspaper headlines in late
          '90s Japan. Amidst all the bizarre resemblances, there is one detail
          that stands out above the rest: the victims have all taken their lives
          by leaping from the Fujou building, a run-down abandoned structure
          rising high above the city. <br />
