          For centuries, many secret organizations have taken part in
          exterminating various types of dangerous monsters. One of them is the
          England-based Hellsing, run by its cunning leader, Sir Integra
          Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing. Her greatest hunter, and trump card, is
          Alucard, an unbeatable vampire genetically modified by her father.
          Despite him being one of "them," he swore to be her protector and
          servant. A new crisis begins and with the help of Seras Victoria, his
          recently turned vampire partner, Alucard has to uncover the truth
          behind the mysterious vampire attacks. Not every human is bound to be
          his ally in this battle, and he will not hesitate to kill anyone who
          stands in his way. <br />

          Ninny Spangcole is the leader of popular girl group, Cecile Die Twice,
          but her ambitions stretch far beyond a successful music career. In the
          hidden underground world of Reverse London, Ninny and her partner Noel
          "Niiha" Niihashi strive to achieve loftier goals as "Witches," members
          of the organization Wing Bind which is dedicated to the handling of
          dragons. These powerful creatures once caused over half of all
          casualties in the city proper, prior to Reverse London splitting away
          from Front London. As dragons are invisible to most Front Londoners,
          their existence has become a mere myth, and Reverse Londoners have
          taken up the front lines. Thus, Wing Bind was created, prohibiting
          non-licensed individuals from coming into any contact with dragons.
          Ninny and Noel have their work cut out for them when they are assigned
          as the caretakers of Balgo Ywain Parks and his dog Osushi-chan. With
          trouble persistently trailing close behind him, the two girls are left
          to deal with the aftermath. Even more problems arise when Macy
          Baljure, Ninnyâ€™s former bandmate, appears in Reverse London with a
          dragon by her side.<br />

          When a mysterious light suddenly engulfs Earth, humanity is left
          petrified, frozen in stone. Thousands of years later, the world is
          teeming with vegetation, and forests have taken the places of cities
          that once stood proudly. One of the very first to emerge from their
          stone prison is Taiju Ooki, who finds that his good friend, a
          brilliant young scientist named Senkuu, has been preparing for his
          awakening. While Taiju wishes to save the girl he loves, Senkuu is
          determined to figure out the cause behind the strange phenomenon and
          restore the world to its former glory. But when they free the
          infamously powerful Tsukasa Shishiou in order to gain an upper hand
          against the dangers in an unfamiliar world, they realize that their
          new comrade has other plans. Tsukasa sees their predicament as a
          chance to start over; free from the corruption and destruction wrought
          by technology, he will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. With both
          sides unable to see eye to eye, Senkuu and his devotion to science
          will clash with Tsukasa and his primal nature in what will truly be a
          battle of the ages. <br />
