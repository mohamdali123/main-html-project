          are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga
          conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, and
          the form has a long prehistory in earlier Japanese art. The term manga
          is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning. Outside of
          Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally
          published in the country. In Japan, people of all ages and walks of
          life read manga. The medium includes works in a broad range of genres:
          action, adventure, business and commerce, comedy, detective, drama,
          historical, horror, mystery, romance, science fiction and fantasy,
          erotica (hentai and ecchi), sports and games, and suspense, among
          others. Many manga are translated into other languages.

          is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan.
          Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to
          animation produced in Japan. However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime
          (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation)
          describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Animation
          produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is
          commonly referred to as anime-influenced animation.

        <p>
          also known as computer games, are electronic games that involves
          interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a
          joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate
          visual feedback. This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video
          display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual
          reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a
          graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess
          can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often
          augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or
          headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including
          haptic technology.
